<h1>The Best Movies According to Carolina</h1>
<h2>Here are my top 3 movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Titanic</h3>
<p>A classic one. Regardless of how long this movie is, it's a classic movie that reflects on what human mistakes can do. It goes to show that we're not perfect, yet ambitious enough to further progress as society. </p>
<p>
<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>Great movie. However, there were a lot of mix feelings. It goes to show how greedy people can be when it comes to war and power. Oppenheimer shows and feels guilty due to the lack of control he has over his own invention.</p>
<h3>Selena</h3>
</p>It is about an aspring Latina singer with so much pontential and tragically died in the end. Jennifer Lopez did a good job.</p>
